        Factors: \newline England Relative to India}}

    \end{center}
    
    \footnotesize{The figures show the sensitivity of the primary
      result to sampling error in hazard ratios. For each figure, we
      regenerated the sample statistic 1000 times, each time drawing a
      hazard ratio for each risk factor from a normal distribution
      with mean and standard deviation equal to those of the hazard
      ratios reported in [Williamson et al. 2020]. The figures show a
      histogram of the statistics generated by this exercise. Panel A
      shows the combined population relative risk from gender and all
      health conditions of mortality from COVID-19 in England divided
      by the statistic in India. The red line at 0.92 is the statistic
      reported in the paper: accounting for the distribution of health
      conditions and gender across all ages lowers modeled deaths in
      England by 8\% (a factor of 0.92) relative to India. Panels B
      and C shows the distribution of deaths under the age of 60 in
      England and India respectively from the same exercise. The red
      lines indicate the values reported in the paper.}

    \footnotesize{The figures show the sensitivity of the primary
      result to sampling error in risk factor prevalences. For each

      distribution with mean and standard deviation equal to those reported
      in the original data sources for each condition. The
