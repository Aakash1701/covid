	abstract = {Background Establishing who is at risk from a novel rapidly arising cause of death, and why, requires a new approach to epidemiological research with very large datasets and timely data. Working on behalf of {NHS} England we therefore set out to deliver a secure and pseudonymised analytics platform inside the data centre of a major primary care electronic health records vendor establishing coverage across detailed primary care records for a substantial proportion of all patients in England. The following results are preliminary. Data sources Primary care electronic health records managed by the electronic health record vendor {TPP}, pseudonymously linked to patient-level data from the {COVID}-19 Patient Notification System ({CPNS}) for death of hospital inpatients with confirmed {COVID}-19, using the new {OpenSAFELY} platform. Population 17,425,445 adults. Time period 1st Feb 2020 to 25th April 2020. Primary outcome Death in hospital among people with confirmed {COVID}-19. Methods Cohort study analysed by Cox-regression to generate hazard ratios: age and sex adjusted, and multiply adjusted for co-variates selected prospectively on the basis of clinical interest and prior findings. Results There were 5683 deaths attributed to {COVID}-19. In summary after full adjustment, death from {COVID}-19 was strongly associated with: being male (hazard ratio 1.99, 95\%{CI} 1.88-2.10); older age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); uncontrolled diabetes ({HR} 2.36 95\% {CI} 2.18-2.56); severe asthma ({HR} 1.25 {CI} 1.08-1.44); and various other prior medical conditions. Compared to people with ethnicity recorded as white, black people were at higher risk of death, with only partial attenuation in hazard ratios from the fully adjusted model (age-sex adjusted {HR} 2.17 95\% {CI} 1.84-2.57; fully adjusted {HR} 1.71 95\% {CI} 1.44-2.02); with similar findings for Asian people (age-sex adjusted {HR} 1.95 95\% {CI} 1.73-2.18; fully adjusted {HR} 1.62 95\% {CI} 1.43-1.82). Conclusions We have quantified a range of clinical risk factors for death from {COVID}-19, some of which were not previously well characterised, in the largest cohort study conducted by any country to date. People from Asian and black groups are at markedly increased risk of in-hospital death from {COVID}-19, and contrary to some prior speculation this is only partially attributable to pre-existing clinical risk factors or deprivation; further research into the drivers of this association is therefore urgently required. Deprivation is also a major risk factor with, again, little of the excess risk explained by co-morbidity or other risk factors. The findings for clinical risk factors are concordant with policies in the {UK} for protecting those at highest risk. Our {OpenSAFELY} platform is rapidly adding further {NHS} patients' records; we will update and extend these results regularly.

	abstract = {Objective To describe outcomes of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in the United States, and the clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with severity of illness.
Design Prospective cohort study.
Setting Single academic medical center in New York City and Long Island.
Participants 5279 patients with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-Cov-2) infection between 1 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. The final date of follow up was 5 May 2020.
Main outcome measures Outcomes were admission to hospital, critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice care, or death), and discharge to hospice care or death. Predictors included patient characteristics, medical history, vital signs, and laboratory results. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and competing risk survival analysis for mortality.
Results Of 11 544 people tested for {SARS}-Cov-2, 5566 (48.2\%) were positive. After exclusions, 5279 were included. 2741 of these 5279 (51.9\%) were admitted to hospital, of whom 1904 (69.5\%) were discharged alive without hospice care and 665 (24.3\%) were discharged to hospice care or died. Of 647 (23.6\%) patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 391 (60.4\%) died and 170 (26.2\%) were extubated or discharged. The strongest risk for hospital admission was associated with age, with an odds ratio of {\textgreater}2 for all age groups older than 44 years and 37.9 (95\% confidence interval 26.1 to 56.0) for ages 75 years and older. Other risks were heart failure (4.4, 2.6 to 8.0), male sex (2.8, 2.4 to 3.2), chronic kidney disease (2.6, 1.9 to 3.6), and any increase in body mass index ({BMI}) (eg, for {BMI} {\textgreater}40: 2.5, 1.8 to 3.4). The strongest risks for critical illness besides age were associated with heart failure (1.9, 1.4 to 2.5), {BMI} {\textgreater}40 (1.5, 1.0 to 2.2), and male sex (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8). Admission oxygen saturation of {\textless}88\% (3.7, 2.8 to 4.8), troponin level {\textgreater}1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), C reactive protein level {\textgreater}200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level {\textgreater}2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) were, however, more strongly associated with critical illness than age or comorbidities. Risk of critical illness decreased significantly over the study period. Similar associations were found for mortality alone.
Conclusions Age and comorbidities were found to be strong predictors of hospital admission and to a lesser extent of critical illness and mortality in people with covid-19; however, impairment of oxygen on admission and markers of inflammation were most strongly associated with critical illness and mortality. Outcomes seem to be improving over time, potentially suggesting improvements in care.},

	abstract = {Background: The first case of {COVID}-19 was detected in Brazil on February 25, 2020. We report the epidemiological, demographic, and clinical findings for confirmed {COVID}-19 cases during the first month of the epidemic in Brazil. Methods: Individual-level and aggregated {COVID}-19 data were analysed to investigate demographic profiles, socioeconomic drivers and age-sex structure of {COVID}-19 tested cases. Basic reproduction numbers (R0) were investigated for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify symptoms associated with confirmed cases and risk factors associated with hospitalization. Laboratory diagnosis for eight respiratory viruses were obtained for 2,429 cases. Findings: By March 25, 1,468 confirmed cases were notified in Brazil, of whom 10\% (147 of 1,468) were hospitalised. Of the cases acquired locally (77.8\%), two thirds (66.9\% of 5,746) were confirmed in private laboratories. Overall, positive association between higher per capita income and {COVID}-19 diagnosis was identified. The median age of detected cases was 39 years ({IQR} 30-53). The median R0 was 2.9 for Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Cardiovascular disease/hypertension were associated with hospitalization. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses, including influenza A and B and human rhinovirus was detected in low levels. Interpretation: Socioeconomic disparity determines access to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 testing in Brazil. The lower median age of infection and hospitalization compared to other countries is expected due to a younger population structure. Enhanced surveillance of respiratory pathogens across socioeconomic statuses is essential to better understand and halt {SARS}-{CoV}-2 transmission.Competing Interest {StatementThe} authors have declared no competing interest.Funding {StatementThis} work was supported by a {FAPESP} (2018/14389-0) and Medical Research Council and {CADDE} partnership award ({MR}/S0195/1). {NRF} is supported by a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship (204311/Z/16/Z). {WMS} is supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation, Brazil (No. 2017/13981-0). {OJB} was funded by a Sir Henry Wellcome Fellowship funded by the Wellcome Trust (206471/Z/17/Z). {VHN} and {CAP} were supported by {FAPESP} (2018/12579-7). {AEZ} and {BG} are supported by Oxford Martin School.Author {DeclarationsAll} relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary {IRB} and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the {IRB}/oversight body are included in the manuscript.{YesAll} necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.{YesI} understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an {ICMJE}-approved registry, such as {ClinicalTrials}.gov.

Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly, how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for {COVID}-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider the age composition of local and national contexts as well as intergenerational interactions. We also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted forecasting of hospitalization and critical care needs.},

	abstract = {Summary Background: Hospitals need to plan for the surge in demand in each state or region in the United States and the European Economic Area ({EEA}) due to the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Planners need forecasts of the most likely trajectory in the coming weeks and will want to plan for the higher values in the range of those forecasts. To date, forecasts of what is most likely to occur in the weeks ahead are not available for states in the {USA} or for all countries in the {EEA}. Methods: This study used data on confirmed {COVID}-19 deaths by day from local and national government websites and {WHO}. Data on hospital capacity and utilisation and observed {COVID}-19 utilisation data from select locations were obtained from publicly available sources and direct contributions of data from select local governments. We develop a mixed effects non-linear regression framework to estimate the trajectory of the cumulative and daily death rate as a function of the implementation of social distancing measures, supported by additional evidence from mobile phone data. An extended mixture model was used in data rich settings to capture asymmetric daily death patterns. Health service needs were forecast using a micro-simulation model that estimates hospital admissions, {ICU} admissions, length of stay, and ventilator need using available data on clinical practices in {COVID}-19 patients. We assume that those jurisdictions that have not implemented school closures, non-essential business closures, and stay at home orders will do so within twenty-one days. Findings: Compared to licensed capacity and average annual occupancy rates, excess demand in the {USA} from {COVID}-19 at the estimated peak of the epidemic (the end of the second week of April) is predicted to be 9,079 (95\% {UI} 253-61,937) total beds and 9,356 (3,526-29,714) {ICU} beds. At the peak of the epidemic, ventilator use is predicted to be 16,545 (8,083-41,991). The corresponding numbers for {EEA} countries are 120,080 (119,183-121,107), 32,291 (32,157-32,425) and 28,973 (28,868-29,085) at a peak of April 6. The date of peak daily deaths varies from March 30 through May 12 by state in the {USA} and March 27 through May 4 by country in the {EEA}. We estimate that through the end of July, there will be 60,308 (34,063-140,381) deaths from {COVID}-19 in the {USA} and 143,088 (101,131-253,163) deaths in the {EEA}. Deaths from {COVID}-19 are estimated to drop below 0.3 per million between May 4 and June 29 by state in the {USA} and between May 4 and July 13 by country in the {EEA}. Timing of the peak need for hospital resource requirements varies considerably across states in the {USA} and across regions of Europe. Interpretation: In addition to a large number of deaths from {COVID}-19, the epidemic will place a load on health system resources well beyond the current capacity of hospitals in the {USA} and {EEA} to manage, especially for {ICU} care and ventilator use. These estimates can help inform the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate this gap, including reducing non-{COVID}-19 demand for services and temporarily increasing system capacity. The estimated excess demand on hospital systems is predicated on the enactment of social distancing measures within three weeks in all locations that have not done so already and maintenance of these measures throughout the epidemic, emphasising the importance of implementing, enforcing, and maintaining these measures to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent deaths.Competing Interest {StatementThe} authors have declared no competing interest.Funding {StatementFunding}: Bill \&amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the state of {WashingtonAuthor} {DeclarationsAll} relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary {IRB} and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the {IRB}/oversight body are included in the manuscript.{YesAll} necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.{YesI} understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an {ICMJE}-approved registry, such as {ClinicalTrials}.gov.

Up to 25\% of people in the United Kingdom are designated high risk—including all adults aged over 70 and those with underlying health conditions such as respiratory and cardiovascular disease, and cancer.5 Strict restrictions are now in place for everyone, reducing movement outside the home to an absolute minimum, except for essential workers.6 These measures will be in place for weeks, possibly months.

	abstract = {Background: Little is known about factors associated with hospitalization and critical illness in Covid-19 positive patients. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of all patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 treated at a single academic health system in New York City between March 1, 2020 and April 2, 2020, with follow up through April 7, 2020. Primary outcomes were hospitalization and critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, hospice and/or death). We conducted multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and maximum information gain decision tree classifications to identify key splitters. Results: Among 4,103 Covid-19 patients, 1,999 (48.7\%) were hospitalized, of whom 981/1,999 (49.1\%) have been discharged home, and 292/1,999 (14.6\%) have died or were discharged to hospice. Of 445 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 162/445 (36.4\%) have died. Strongest hospitalization risks were age ≥75 years ({OR} 66.8, 95\% {CI}, 44.7-102.6), age 65-74 ({OR} 10.9, 95\% {CI}, 8.35-14.34), {BMI}\&gt;40 ({OR} 6.2, 95\% {CI}, 4.2-9.3), and heart failure ({OR} 4.3 95\% {CI}, 1.9-11.2). Strongest critical illness risks were admission oxygen saturation \&lt;88\% ({OR} 6.99, 95\% {CI} 4.5-11.0), d-dimer\&gt;2500 ({OR} 6.9, 95\% {CI}, 3.2-15.2), ferritin \&gt;2500 ({OR} 6.9, 95\% {CI}, 3.2-15.2), and C-reactive protein ({CRP}) \&gt;200 ({OR} 5.78, 95\% {CI}, 2.6-13.8). In the decision tree for admission, the most important features were age \&gt;65 and obesity; for critical illness, the most important was {SpO}2\&lt;88, followed by procalcitonin \&gt;0.5, troponin \&lt;0.1 (protective), age \&gt;64 and {CRP}\&gt;200. Conclusions: Age and comorbidities are powerful predictors of hospitalization; however, admission oxygen impairment and markers of inflammation are most strongly associated with critical illness.Competing Interest {StatementThe} authors have declared no competing interest.Funding {StatementThis} work was funded in part by the Kenneth C.

Demographics, baseline comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and test results were also collected.A total of 5700 patients were included (median age, 63 years [interquartile range \{{IQR}\}, 52-75; range, 0-107 years]; 39.7\% female). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (3026; 56.6\%), obesity (1737; 41.7\%), and diabetes (1808; 33.8\%). At triage, 30.7\% of patients were febrile, 17.3\% had a respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/min, and 27.8\% received supplemental oxygen. The rate of respiratory virus co-infection was 2.1\%. Outcomes were assessed for 2634 patients who were discharged or had died at the study end point. During hospitalization, 373 patients (14.2\%) (median age, 68 years [{IQR}, 56-78]; 33.5\% female) were treated in the intensive care unit care, 320 (12.2\%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 81 (3.2\%) were treated with kidney replacement therapy, and 553 (21\%) died. As of April 4, 2020, for patients requiring mechanical ventilation (n = 1151, 20.2\%), 38 (3.3\%) were discharged alive, 282 (24.5\%) died, and 831 (72.2\%) remained in hospital. The median postdischarge follow-up time was 4.4 days ({IQR}, 2.2-9.3). A total of 45 patients (2.2\%) were readmitted during the study period. The median time to readmission was 3 days ({IQR}, 1.0-4.5) for readmitted patients. Among the 3066 patients who remained hospitalized at the final study follow-up date (median age, 65 years [{IQR}, 54-75]), the median follow-up at time of censoring was 4.5 days ({IQR}, 2.4-8.1).This case series provides characteristics and early outcomes of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed {COVID}-19 in the New York City area.},

	abstract = {Background: Older {COVID}-19 hospitalized patients frequently have hypertension, diabetes or coronary heart disease ({CHD}), but whether these are more common than in the population is unclear. During the initial epidemic in England, virus testing for older adults was restricted to symptomatic hospitalized patients. We aimed to estimate associations between pre-existing diagnoses and {COVID}-19 status, in a large community cohort. Methods: {UK} Biobank (England) participants assessed 2006 to 2010, followed in hospital discharge records to 2017. Demographic and pre-existing common diagnoses association tested with {COVID}-19 status (16th March to 14th April 2020) in logistic models, adjusted for demographics, study site and other diagnoses. Results: There were 274,356 participants aged 65+, including 448 (0.16\%) hospitalized {COVID}-19 patients. Common co-morbidities in patients were hypertension (58.5\%), coronary heart disease ({CHD}, 21.1\%), history of fall or fragility fractures (30.6\%), and type 2 diabetes (19.6\%). However, in adjusted models, {COVID}-19 patients were more likely than other participants to have pre-existing dementia ({OR}=3.07 95\% {CI} 1.71 to 5.50), {COPD} ({OR}= 1.82 {CI} 1.33 to 2.49), depression ({OR}=1.81 {CI} 1.36 to 2.40), type 2 diabetes ({OR}=1.70 {CI} 1.30 to 2.21), chronic kidney disease and atrial fibrillation. Hypertension was modestly associated ({OR}=1.29 {CI} 1.04 to 1.59), but {CHD} ({OR}=0.92 {CI} 0.71 to 1.20) prevalence was similar in {COVID}-19 patients and other participants. Conclusion: Specific co-morbidities are disproportionally common in older adults who develop severe {COVID}-19. Tailored interventions may be needed, as these results do not support simple age-based targeting to prevent severe {COVID}-19 infection.Competing Interest {StatementThe} authors have declared no competing interest.Funding {StatementUK} Medical Research Council award {MR}/S009892/1 ({PI} Melzer) supports {JLA}. {DM} and {LCP} are supported by the University of Exeter Medical School, and in part by the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. {JAHM} is supported by {NIHR} Doctoral Research Fellowship {DRF}-2014-07-177.

Data were available for 11 European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, {UK}), Canada, and 12 {US} states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and New York) We also examined available data on {COVID}-19 deaths in people with age \&lt;65 and no underlying diseases. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Proportion of {COVID}-19 deaths in people \&lt;65 years old; relative risk of {COVID}-19 death in people \&lt;65 versus ≥65 years old; absolute risk of {COVID}-19 death in people \&lt;65 and in those ≥80 years old in the general population as of May 1, 2020; absolute {COVID}-19 death risk expressed as equivalent of death risk from driving a motor vehicle. {RESULTS}: Individuals with age \&lt;65 account for 4.8-9.3\% of all {COVID}-19 deaths in 10 European countries and Canada, 13.0\% in the {UK}, and 7.8-23.9\% in the {US} locations. People \&lt;65 years old had 36- to 84-fold lower risk of {COVID}-19 death than those ≥65 years old in 10 European countries and Canada and 14- to 56-fold lower risk in {UK} and {US} locations. The absolute risk of {COVID}-19 death as of May 1, 2020 for people \&lt;65 years old ranged from 6 (Canada) to 249 per million (New York City). The absolute risk of {COVID}-19 death for people ≥80 years old ranged from 0.3 (Florida) to 10.6 per thousand (New York). The {COVID}-19 death risk in people \&lt;65 years old during the period of fatalities from the epidemic was equivalent to the death risk from driving between 13 and 101 miles per day for 11 countries and 6 states, and was higher (equivalent to the death risk from driving 143-668 miles per day) for 6 other states and the {UK}. People \&lt;65 years old without underlying predisposing conditions accounted for only 0.7-2.6\% of all {COVID}-19 deaths (data available from France, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Georgia, and New York City). {CONCLUSIONS}: People \&lt;65 years old have very small risks of {COVID}-19 death even in pandemic epicenters and deaths for people \&lt;65 years without underlying predisposing conditions are remarkably uncommon.

The present study aims to estimate the risk factors for hospitalisation and death in the Mexican population infected by {SARS}-{CoV}-2. Methods and Findings. We used the publicly available data released by the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Diseases of the Mexican Ministry of Health (Secretaria de Salud, {SS}). All records of positive {SARS}-{CoV}-2 cases were included. Two multiple logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the association between the hospitalisation and mortality, with other covariables. Data on 10,544 individuals (57.68\% men), with mean age 46.47 {SD} 15.62, were analysed. Men were about 1.54 times as likely to be hospitalized than women (p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 1.37-1.74); individuals aged 50-74 and \&gt;=74 years were more likely to be hospitalized than people from 25-49 years ({OR} 2.05, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 1.81-2.32, and {OR} 23.84, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 2.90-5.15, respectively). People with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were more likely to be hospitalised than people without these morbidities (p\&lt;0.01). Men had more risk of death in comparison to women ({OR}=1.53, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 1.30-1.81) and individuals aged 50-74 and ≥75 years were more likely to die than people from 25-49 years ({OR} 1.96, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 1.63-2.34, and {OR} 3.74, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 2.80-4.98, respectively). Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes presented in combination, provided a higher risk of dying in comparison to not having these diseases ({OR}=2.10; p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 1.50-2.93). Hospitalisation, intubation and pneumonia conferred a higher risk of dying ({OR} 5.02, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 3.88-6.50; {OR} 4.27, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 3.26-5.59, and {OR}=2.57; p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 2.11-3.13, respectively). The main limitation of our study is the lack of information on mild (asymptomatic) or moderate cases of {COVID}-19. Conclusions. The present study points out that in Mexico, where an important proportion of the population develops two or more chronic conditions simultaneously, high mortality is a sever outcome for those infected by {SARS}-{CoV}-2.Competing Interest {StatementThe} authors have declared no competing interest.Funding {StatementThis} project was supported by a grant from the Secretaria de Educacion, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion de la Ciudad de Mexico {CM}-{SECTEI}/041/2020 "Red colaborativa de Investigación Traslacional para el Envejecimiento Saludable de la Ciudad de Mexico" ({RECITES}).

	abstract = {We aimed to estimate the prevalence, healthcare costs and number of deaths among people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) in England and Scotland 2011–2030. We adapted the Dutch {COPD} Model by using English and Scottish demographic, {COPD} incidence, {COPD} prevalence, smoking prevalence and mortality data to make projections. In England, the prevalence of {COPD} was estimated to be 1.79\% (95\% uncertainty interval 1.77–1.81) in 2011, increasing to 2.19\% (1.85–2.33) by 2030. In Scotland, prevalence was 2.03\% (1.96–2.10) in 2011 increasing to 2.20\% (1.98–2.40) in 2030. These increases were driven by more women developing {COPD}. Annual direct healthcare costs of {COPD} in England were estimated to increase from £1.50 billon (1.18–2.50) in 2011 to £2.32 (1.85–3.08) billion in 2030. In Scotland, costs increased from £159 million (128–268) in 2011 to £207 (165–274) million in 2030. The deaths in England were estimated to increase from 99,200 (92,500–128,500) in 2011, to 129,400 (126,400–133,400) by 2030. In Scotland, in 2011 there were 9,700 (9,000–12,300) deaths and 13,900 (13,400–14,500) deaths in 2030. The number of people with {COPD} will increase substantially over the coming years in England and Scotland, particularly in females. Services need to adapt to this increasing demand.},
