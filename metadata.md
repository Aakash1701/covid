| Abstract                    | The Indian Population Census is a complete enumeration of households in India. The Population Census Abstract (PCA) includes the number of households and population of men and women in various social groups, and the number of workers in different occupation classes.The Population Census also publishes village and town directories, which describe an increasingly large set of local amenities. The amenities include but are not limited to data on infrastructure (paved road, electrification, etc), the distance of villages to the nearest town, the presence of post offices and various medical facilities, the number of market days, and the sources of water. A different amenity list is used for census villages and census towns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Data Collection Mode        | The Census Operations in India are carried out in two phases - the Houselisting and Housing Census followed by the Population Enumeration. The objective of the Houselisting and Housing Census is to systematically list out all the structures, houses and households throughout the country for preparation of a sound frame for conduct of the Population Enumeration. All the buildings and houses wherever necessary are numbered for easy identification at the time of actual enumeration. The Houselisting and Housing Census was conducted in different States and Union Territories during April-September 2010. In addition to collecting data on characteristics of the house, information on availability of certain amenities and assets to the households were also collected in this first phase. <br/><br/>The Population Enumeration was undertaken during 9th to 28th February 2011 (both days inclusive). A revisional round was conducted from 1st to 5th March 2011. The Census Moment, the referral time at which the snapshot of the population is taken, is 00.00 hours of 1st March 2011. In parts of the States of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, which are snow-bound in February, the Population Enumeration was carried out non-synchronously from 11th September, 2010 to 30th September, 2010 with a revisional round from 1st October, 2010 to 5th October, 2010. The houseless population, as has been the usual practice, was enumerated on the night of 28th February 2011. |
