| Abstract                    | The Indian Population Census is a complete enumeration of households in India. The Population Census Abstract (PCA) includes the number of households and population of men and women in various social groups, and the number of workers in different occupation classes.The Population Census also publishes village and town directories, which describe an increasingly large set of local amenities. The amenities include but are not limited to data on infrastructure (paved road, electrification, etc), the distance of villages to the nearest town, the presence of post offices and various medical facilities, the number of market days, and the sources of water. A different amenity list is used for census villages and census towns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Data Collection Mode        | The Census Operations in India are carried out in two phases - the Houselisting and Housing Census followed by the Population Enumeration. The objective of the Houselisting and Housing Census is to systematically list out all the structures, houses and households throughout the country for preparation of a sound frame for conduct of the Population Enumeration. All the buildings and houses wherever necessary are numbered for easy identification at the time of actual enumeration. The Houselisting and Housing Census was conducted in different States and Union Territories during April-September 2010. In addition to collecting data on characteristics of the house, information on availability of certain amenities and assets to the households were also collected in this first phase. <br/><br/>The Population Enumeration was undertaken during 9th to 28th February 2011 (both days inclusive). A revisional round was conducted from 1st to 5th March 2011. The Census Moment, the referral time at which the snapshot of the population is taken, is 00.00 hours of 1st March 2011. In parts of the States of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, which are snow-bound in February, the Population Enumeration was carried out non-synchronously from 11th September, 2010 to 30th September, 2010 with a revisional round from 1st October, 2010 to 5th October, 2010. The houseless population, as has been the usual practice, was enumerated on the night of 28th February 2011. |

| Abstract                    | The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India, conducted the fourth round of the District Level Household and Facility Survey (DLHS-4) in all the States and Union Territories of India. Three previous rounds of the District Level Household and Facility Surveys (DLHS) were conducted in 1998-99, 2002-04, and 2007-08. The main objective to provide reproductive and child health data at the district level in India. The data from these surveys have been useful in setting the benchmarks and examining the progress the country has made after the implementation of the Reproductive and Child Health programme. These surveys were useful for the central and state governments in evaluation, monitoring and planning strategies. In view of the completion of six years of National Rural Health Mission (2005-12), there is a felt need to focus on the achievements and improvements so far. Hence, MoHFW initiated the DLHS-4 and entrusted the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) as the national nodal agency to conduct DLHS-4. The DLHS-4 includes both a household survey and a facilities survey. |

| Sampling Procedure          | The household survey is a multi-stage stratified random sample, with villages as the primary sampling unit in rural areas and NSSO Urban Frame Survey (UFS) blocks in urban areas. Households are then randomly sampled with the chosen PSUs. For the facilities survey, the DLHS-4 conducted a census of all public district/subdistrict hospitals (DH/SDHs) and community health centers (CHCs), but a sample of primary health centers (PHCs) and sub-health centers (SHCs), specifically those serving the PSUs for the HH survey. Note that this survey does not include private hospitals or special public facilities such as teaching hospitals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Weighting                   | In the facilities survey data there is no weight variable but it does include population covered, so district-level estimates of sampled PHCs and SHCs is produced by upscaling values by (total district population / population served).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
